                    <h2>The Thing About Gluten</h2>
                    <p>Before jumping into the nitty-gritty of my technique, you must unlearn what you have learned from
                        other recipes. We've been warned about the "evils" of gluten so many times that some bakers have
                        a deep-seated fear of overworking the dough. That's a crummy mindset to carry into the kitchen,
                        because fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering. Pretty much sums
                        things up, huh? We're so afraid of gluten, we'll do just about anything to avoid it, but then we
                        find ourselves angry at doughs that rip and tear, and we hate our crusts as they slump out of
                        shape in the oven.</p>
                    <p>To transcend that suffering, we have to realize that gluten isn't the enemy of our dough. If it
                        were, we'd have all switched to a gluten-free recipe by now. Gluten is the force that gives
                        pastry its power, that binds a crust together. It strengthens dough so that we can wield it with
                        confidence, knowing it won't fall apart in our hands.</p>
                    <p>With gluten on our side, pie dough should feel as comfortable as a worn leather jacket, flexible
                        and soft but strong. Sure, the dark side of gluten is that it can make a pie crust tough, but
                        that's where love butter comes in. It brings balance to the force, so pie dough turns out tender
                        and crisp. In culinary school, I learned that a 1:1 ratio of flour to butter by weight is ideal.
                        That may seem like more than you're used to, but it's a tried-and-true pastry formula that
                        improves the flexibility of the dough.</p>
                    <h2>Smash It</h2>
                    <img src="../image/vi4.webp" class="img">
                    <p>Happily, the technique for getting the crust extra flaky is actually pretty fun, at least if
                        you're the sort of person who likes to pop bubble wrap and make paper planes, because it all
                        boils down to smashing and folding. Here's the deal: Cut up some cold butter, toss it with
                        flour, and squish each cube flat. That's it; no "coarse meal" or "pea-sized bits" to try to
                        judge by eye. No guesswork when it comes to adding the water, either—the amount you add will
                        always be exactly 50% of the flour by weight. Once it's incorporated, knead until the dough
                        forms a lumpy ball; the butter itself will work as a binder while simultaneously keeping the
                        gluten from becoming dangerously powerful.</p>
                    <h2>Roll It</h2>
                    <img src="../image/vi5.webp" class="img">
                    <p>Once all the floury bits have been absorbed, plop the dough onto a well-floured surface and
                        sprinkle more flour on top. Seriously, have at it! Any excess flour can be brushed off later on,
                        so there's absolutely no reason to scrape by with the bare minimum. Use as much flour as you
                        need to feel 100% confident as you roll.</p>
