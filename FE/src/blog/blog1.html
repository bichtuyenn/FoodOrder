                    <h2>The Leads</h2>
                    <img src="../image/blog1.webp" class="img">
                    <p>A good mushroom gravy should put the mushrooms front and center—I wanted that earthy, woodsy
                        flavor to be clean and present. That meant reaching for a combination of fresh cremini mushrooms
                        and dried porcini, which together deliver a one-two punch of mushroom intensity. The porcinis
                        have the added benefit of flavoring the stock more deeply as they steep in it to soften.</p>
                    <h2>The Support</h2>
                    <img src="../image/blog1.1.webp" class="img">
                    <p>Mushrooms are just half the battle, though. The stock is another critically important component.
                        You have options here. The easiest is to grab some good quality store-bought chicken stock,
                        which produces a flavorful gravy thanks to all the work the mushrooms are doing. Of course, you
                        can make this gravy even more delicious with homemade stock, which has a richer, deeper, and
                        more complex flavor than most store-bought options.</p>
                    <p>We don't typically recommend store-bought beef stock, as its flavor is typically a far cry from
                        any kind of real beef stock, but if you have homemade beef stock, you can certainly add it here
                        for an even meatier flavor profile. In our own testing, though, we found that beef stock alone
                        can overpower the gravy, so we recommend blending with chicken stock (even store-bought is fine
                        if using two stocks) to cut its intensity.</p>
                    <h2>The Cameos</h2>
                    <img src="../image/blog1.2.webp" class="img">
                    <p>Many mushroom gravy recipes call for wine, but even a small amount of red wine whisked in right
                        before I added the stock left the gravy with a sourness that distracted from the unadulterated
                        mushroom flavor. On the other hand, a splash of sherry mixed in at the very end made the gravy
                        taste brighter and created a contrast that seemed to bring out the mushrooms even more
                        forcefully.</p>
                    <img src="../image/blog1.3.webp" class="img">
                    <p>So in the end, it was simply a mix of mushrooms, stock, and a little sherry that ruled the day.
                        The result is an intensely mushroomy gravy that would find a good home on steak, mashed
                        potatoes, biscuits, or smothered on breaded and fried pork chops.</p>
